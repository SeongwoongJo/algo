# Introduction to Algorithms

This course provides an introduction to mathematical modeling of computational problems and the design andanalysis of the algorithms that solve these problems in practice. It covers the common algorithms, algorithmicparadigms, and data structures used to solve these problems. The course emphasizes the relationship betweenalgorithms and programming and introduces basic performance measures and analysis techniques for these problems.

# Course Objective 
This course introduces to the analysis and design of computer algorithms. Upon completion of this course:
- Analyze the asymptotic performance of algorithms
