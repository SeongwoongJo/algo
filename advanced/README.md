# Advanced Algorithms

    It covers advanced methods of algorithmic design, analysis, and implementation. Techniques to be covered include amortization, advanced data structures such as Fibonacci heap and union-find, shortest paths, network flow, linear programming, randomized algorithms, string matching, approximation algorithms, and multithreaded programming. 

# Objectives
